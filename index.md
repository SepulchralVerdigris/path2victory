# How you can help

## Playtest!

Test out the *Path 2 Victory* rules in a variety of different conditions. 

## Website

As you can see, this website is barebones. Any additional functionality would be greatly appreciated. 

## Game design

The foundation of the game is there, but there are some unresolved issues/questions:

* Are the points values set at the right level? Should higher-level creatures cost more than they currently do?
* Is a visual cue needed on creature cards to indicate that Fight rolls are only made for strikes, not other attacks? 
* Is there a better way to handle fear and morale: refusing to advance, retreating, getting rattled â€¦ 
* Should all HP and damage be a multiple of 5? If so, how to account for low-level monsters where the difference of 1 HP is significant? 
* Are "save for half" effects too powerful in a game where level -1 creatures have to be balanced against level 14 creatures?
* Are area of effect attacks too powerful?
