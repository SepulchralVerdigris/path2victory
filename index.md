## P2V: Roleplay

You might like *P2V: Roleplay* if: 

* You’re intrigued by Pathfinder 2E but find the rules daunting.

* You’d like to play adventures solo, with a whole adventuring party under your control. 

* You want to play without a Game Master. 
* You want to make original characters to play in *Path 2 Victory* skirmishes. 

* You enjoy open source: *Path 2 Victory* is under the same ORC License as the original game.

## Game design

The foundation of the game is there, but there are some unresolved issues/questions:

* Are the points values set at the right level? Should higher-level creatures cost more than they currently do?
* Is a visual cue needed on creature cards to indicate that Fight rolls are only made for strikes, not other attacks? 
* Is there a better way to handle fear and morale: refusing to advance, retreating, getting rattled … 
* Should all HP and damage be a multiple of 5? If so, how to account for low-level monsters where the difference of 1 HP is significant? 
* Are "save for half" effects too powerful in a game where level -1 creatures have to be balanced against level 14 creatures?
* Are area of effect attacks too powerful?
