# Characters

Creating characters in *Path 2 Victory* is so quick and fun I've been doing it for some of the Creative Commons-licensed character sketches **Bertdrawsstuff** makes (see them for yourself [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Phlcr2KzSRjWj1Ck1iyiE9EUvUhhVdeE?usp=drive_link)).

I started with the Duellist:

If we had converted the Swashbuckler to *Path 2 Victory* yet, that would be a natural place to start, but it looks like rogue or fighter would work too. 

I decide on rogue, and starting at level 6 allows for a couple of feats in the fighter archetype. 

Between Fleet, Nimble Dodge, Reactive Strike and Fighter Resiliency, I reckon we have an agile but formidable melee combatant who is particularly dangerous when his enemy is off-balance or surprised.

The Mage Hunter proved a bit trickier. Despite the name, he seems to be a magic-user himself - but I haven't adapted the Magus (and probably won't until there is an ORC licensed version). 

One of the advantages of *Path 2 Victory* characters being so sparse, though, is that a few key choices can really define a character. In this case, maybe Counterspell and the Detective background (i.e., training in Society) is enough to define this character as a "mage hunter". 

I give him Light Armor Proficiency to help model a gish, and pick out spells recommended in a "how to make a PF2e gish" guide I found online.

With *summon undead* a first-level spell for wizards and clerics, I felt spoiled for choice for modelling a necromancer in *Path 2 Victory*. 

He does have a wicked-looking dagger (is that held by a third, skeletal arm? Or is it suspended from his belt?), but I thought cloistered cleric was most appropriate - and *touch of death* will still give him a reason to wade into melee from time to time. 

Level 2 allowed me to work in Versatile Font, which gives him power over life and death.

The next three characters use classes that haven't been published just yet - the Ranger, Bard and Barbarian.

The archer is straightforward - a level 1 ranger with the Martial Disciple archetype and the Initiate Warden feat to pick up *gravity weapon*. With the longbow taking a free action, and characters limited to one free action per round, Flurry does not seem particularly useful. However, there's a rule change coming to *Path 2 Victory* that allows a flurrying ranger with a longbow to shoot twice (getting the reduced MAP on the second strike in a round).

<img src="Character cards\Bard.jpg"  style="width: 300px" />

Since the image is literally titled "Bard", I figured as straightforward a bard as possible was the way to go. The bard is *Path 2 Victory*'s first occult caster - but this character hasn't picked up the creepy, spooky or psychic spells that are also present on the occult list. 

*Lingering composition* lets the bard keep *courageous anthem* going an extra round, freeing more time for illusions and rapier strikes.

Spiked Cloak is a barbarian. Not much to write home about here. I'd like something that reflects his magnificent spiked cloak - some way of counterattacking or damaging someone who makes a melee attack against him, for example. Let me know if you have any ideas and I can put together a higher-level version.
