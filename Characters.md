# Characters

Creating characters in *Path 2 Victory* is so quick and fun I've been doing it for some of the Creative Commons-licensed character sketches **Bertdrawsstuff** makes (see them for yourself [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Phlcr2KzSRjWj1Ck1iyiE9EUvUhhVdeE?usp=drive_link)).

I started with the Duellist:

If I had converted the Swashbuckler to *Path 2 Victory* yet, that would be a natural place to start, but it looks like rogue or fighter would work too. 

I decide on rogue, and starting at level 6 allows for a couple of feats in the fighter archetype. 

Between Fleet, Nimble Dodge, Reactive Strike and Fighter Resiliency, I reckon we have an agile but formidable melee combatant who is particularly dangerous when his enemy is off-balance or surprised.

The Mage Hunter proved a bit trickier. Despite the name, he seems to be a magic-user himself - but I haven't adapted the Magus (and probably won't until there is an ORC licensed version). 

One of the advantages of *Path 2 Victory* characters being so sparse, though, is that a few key choices can really define a character. In this case, maybe Counterspell and the Detective background (i.e., training in Society) is enough to define this character as a "mage hunter". 

I give him Light Armor Proficiency to help model a gish, and pick out spells recommended in a "how to make a PF2e gish" guide I found online.

With *summon undead* a first-level spell for wizards and clerics, I felt spoiled for choice for modelling a necromancer in *Path 2 Victory*. 

He does have a wicked-looking dagger (is that held by a third, skeletal arm? Or is it suspended from his belt?), but I thought cloistered cleric was most appropriate - and *touch of death* will still give him a reason to wade into melee from time to time. 

Level 2 allowed me to work in Versatile Font, which gives him power over life and death.
