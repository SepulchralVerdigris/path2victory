# Appendix: Special objectives

Some objectives have other effects as well. Examples below. Where a creature is involved, any skill checks use the creature‚Äôs Power unless another number is specified. 

**Arcane Grimoire (Arcana):** When this objective is claimed, remove it from play. The creature that claimed the objective gains a spell scroll of their level or lower (the player choose the spell, and it does not need to be an arcane spell). As long as the creature holds that scroll, they count as holding the objective. 

**Unactivated Golem (Arcana):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on a construct and use its stats, for example animated armor or a soulbound doll.

Make an Arcana check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the construct immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player‚Äôs opponent.

A creature that has claimed an Unactivated Golem can spend any number of action points to have the construct take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Sword in the Stone (Athletics):** When this objective is claimed, remove it from play. The creature that claimed it gains a magic melee weapon of their level or lower, like a *fiery longsword* or *ghost touch warhammer.* As long as the creature holds that weapon, they count as holding the objective.

**Alchemist‚Äôs Table (Crafting):** Make a Crafting check to claim the objective. On a success, also gain one consumable of the active creature‚Äôs level or lower. On a failure, roll 1d6. On a 1, the table explodes. Remove it from play and do 20 fire damage in emanation 2 (Reflex half). 

**Merchant (Diplomacy):** Make a Diplomacy check to claim this objective. Creatures on the warband that has claimed the objective can Trade (2 AP) to swap any one item for another item of the same level or lower, if they are adjacent to the merchant. 

**Ancient Runes (Lore):** The warband that claims this objective receives a +2 bonus on all skill checks to claim other objectives.

**Invalid (Medicine):** Make a Medicine check to claim this objective. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, remove the objective from play. 

**Wild Animal (Nature):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on an animal and use its stats, for example a boar. 

Make a Nature check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the animal immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player‚Äôs opponent. 

A creature that has claimed a Wild Animal can spend any number of action points to have the animal take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Ambulant Shrine (Occultism):** Make an Occultism check to claim this objective. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the objective moves in a random direction 5 squares (or until it hits an occupied space). 

**Mercurial Fey (Performance):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on a fey and use its stats, for example a naiad or grig. 

Make a Performance check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the fey immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player‚Äôs opponent. 

A creature that has claimed a Mercurial Fey can spend any number of action points to have the fey take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Altar (Religion):** If the Altar is unclaimed or claimed by another warband, make a Religion check. On a success, claim the objective and the active creature or a creature within 4 squares heals 10 hit points. 

**Web-Wrapped Victim (Survival):** Make a Survival check to claim this objective. On a failure, the active creature is encumbered. 

**Trapped Treasure Chest (Thievery):** Make a Thievery check to claim this objective. On a failure, take 5 persistent poison damage and become sickened. 

# Appendix: Positioning upgrades

Because PF2e is a roleplaying game, it typically does not have special rules for how creatures deploy. What follows are upgrades that can be taken to expand creatures in this way.

Like other upgrades, players increase the point cost of creatures that take these upgrades. 

**False Object:** A creature that can change shape into a tree, statue or other obstacle or item can take this upgrade. When placing terrain, place one additional obstacle or item of the same Size as the disguised creature. In secret, the player whose creature has False Object identifies which obstacle or item is actually the creature in disguise. 

At any time that a creature is within 2 squares of the disguised creature, the disguised creature can as a reaction leave its disguise and take a Strike or Stride action. Replace the obstacle or item with the creature‚Äôs miniature. 

The creature can also leave its disguise by choice, at the end of any round. However, in that case it cannot be activated in that round (only in subsequent rounds). 

**Summonable:** A creature that comes from another plane can take this upgrade. When deploying, leave this creature out of play. 

At any point during play, an allied creature who can cast spells can spend 2 AP and place the summonable creature in an adjacent unoccupied space. The summonable creature can act that round. 

**Tempting Disguise:** A creature that can change shape into something alluring can take this upgrade. When placing objectives, place one additional objective. In secret, the player whose creature has Tempting Disguise identifies which objective is actually the creature in disguise. 

When a creature attempts to interact with the disguised creature, their skill check automatically fails. Replace the objective with the creature‚Äôs miniature. That creature can be activated as normal at some point during the round (and ongoing after that).

The creature can also leave its disguise by choice, at the end of any round. However, in that case it cannot be activated in that round (only in subsequent rounds). 

**Trail of Bodies:** A creature that makes use of dead bodies, like a zombie hulk, can begin play with 1d6 dead bodies scattered around the map (players alternate placing them where they wish). 

## Spotting a disguised creature

A creature within 6 squares of a disguised creature (Tempting Disguise, Statue Disguise, etc) or an objective, statue, etc that might *be* a disguised creature, can Interact with it provided they have line of effect. Make a Perception check against the disguised creature‚Äôs Power. On a success, the player who controls the relevant creature reveal whether what is being Interacted with is in fact the disguised creature or not.

# Appendix: Campaign play

The following rules can be used to play with the same creatures over many scenarios. 

## Recovering

After a scenario, all creatures heal all damage and lose all conditions. All spell effects end. 

All features (including spells) that are usable once per encounter (üÑ¥) are usable again. The scenario will specify if all features that are usable once per day (üÑ≥) are usable again too. As a rule of thumb, creatures should recover their daily features after every third scenario. 

## Injuries

Roll 1d6 for each creature that was eliminated in the scenario. 

##### Table 1: Eliminated creatures

| **D6** | **Outcome**   | **Effect**                                         |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1‚Äì2    | Out of Action | The creature cannot be used in  the next scenario. |
| 3‚Äì4    | Wounded       | Roll on the injuries table.                        |
| 5‚Äì6    | Full recovery | The creature is good as new.                       |

 

##### Table 2: Injuries

| **D6** | **Injury**  | **Effect**                                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Injured Leg | -1 Speed.                                       |
| **2**  | Injured Eye | -1 Fight.                                       |
| **3**  | Befuddled   | -1 Power.                                       |
| **4**  | Cursed      | -1 Fortitude, Reflex and Will.                  |
| **5**  | Fragile     | -1 Armor                                        |
| **6**  | Weakened    | Start the encounter with the slowed  condition. |

 

A creature that already has a wound that would become Wounded again instead has that wound permanently. Otherwise, a wounded creature that completes a scenario with that wound loses the wound. 

## Advancement

Each time a creature participates in a scenario, they get an upgrade. Roll 3d6 for each creature to see what upgrade they receive. 

##### Table 3: Upgrades

| **Result** | **Benefit**  | **Result** | **Benefit** |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| **3**      | Feat         | **11**     | +1 Power    |
| **4**      | +1 Will      | **12**     | +1 Armor    |
| **5**      | +1 Fortitude | **13**     | +1 Will     |
| **6**      | +1 Armor     | **14**     | Feat        |
| **7**      | Feat         | **15**     | +1 Attack   |
| **8**      | +1 Fortitude | **16**     | +1 Power    |
| **9**      | +1 Reflex    | **17**     | +1 Will     |
| **10**     | +1 Attack    | **18**     | +1 Reflex   |

 

Immediately upon receiving every third upgrade, a creature goes up a level (and their points cost increases commensurately). Their hit points and damage also increase. 

*Hit Points:* Increases as specified by their class. For creatures without a class, find a class that would give them roughly equivalent hit points at their current level, and follow its progression. 

*Damage:* Look up their previous level and damage, and compare it with the damage in the same column for the new level. 

##### Table 4: Damage progression

## Class table

Use this table to determine how a class is expected to progress in terms of damage and HP, and what the expected starting stats are for first level creatures of that class. 

When converting creatures over from PF2e, it is perfectly okay for their numbers to differ from those given here. They have been built using different, valid rules.
