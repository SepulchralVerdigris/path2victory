# Appendix: Special objectives

Some objectives have other effects as well. Examples below. Where a creature is involved, any skill checks use the creature’s Power unless another number is specified. 

**Arcane Grimoire (Arcana):** When this objective is claimed, remove it from play. The creature that claimed the objective gains a spell scroll of their level or lower (the player choose the spell, and it does not need to be an arcane spell). As long as the creature holds that scroll, they count as holding the objective. 

**Unactivated Golem (Arcana):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on a construct and use its stats, for example animated armor or a soulbound doll.

Make an Arcana check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the construct immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player’s opponent.

A creature that has claimed an Unactivated Golem can spend any number of action points to have the construct take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Sword in the Stone (Athletics):** When this objective is claimed, remove it from play. The creature that claimed it gains a magic melee weapon of their level or lower, like a *fiery longsword* or *ghost touch warhammer.* As long as the creature holds that weapon, they count as holding the objective.

**Alchemist’s Table (Crafting):** Make a Crafting check to claim the objective. On a success, also gain one consumable of the active creature’s level or lower. On a failure, roll 1d6. On a 1, the table explodes. Remove it from play and do 20 fire damage in emanation 2 (Reflex half). 

**Merchant (Diplomacy):** Make a Diplomacy check to claim this objective. Creatures on the warband that has claimed the objective can Trade (2 AP) to swap any one item for another item of the same level or lower, if they are adjacent to the merchant. 

**Ancient Runes (Lore):** The warband that claims this objective receives a +2 bonus on all skill checks to claim other objectives.

**Invalid (Medicine):** Make a Medicine check to claim this objective. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, remove the objective from play. 

**Wild Animal (Nature):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on an animal and use its stats, for example a boar. 

Make a Nature check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the animal immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player’s opponent. 

A creature that has claimed a Wild Animal can spend any number of action points to have the animal take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Ambulant Shrine (Occultism):** Make an Occultism check to claim this objective. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the objective moves in a random direction 5 squares (or until it hits an occupied space). 

**Mercurial Fey (Performance):** When placing this objective, the players should agree on a fey and use its stats, for example a naiad or grig. 

Make a Performance check. On a success, claim the objective. On a failure, the fey immediately takes a turn (with 2 AP), controlled by the player’s opponent. 

A creature that has claimed a Mercurial Fey can spend any number of action points to have the fey take one action that costs that many action points. 

**Altar (Religion):** If the Altar is unclaimed or claimed by another warband, make a Religion check. On a success, claim the objective and the active creature or a creature within 4 squares heals 10 hit points. 

**Web-Wrapped Victim (Survival):** Make a Survival check to claim this objective. On a failure, the active creature is encumbered. 

**Trapped Treasure Chest (Thievery):** Make a Thievery check to claim this objective. On a failure, take 5 persistent poison damage and become sickened. 

# Appendix: Positioning upgrades

Because PF2e is a roleplaying game, it typically does not have special rules for how creatures deploy. What follows are upgrades that can be taken to expand creatures in this way.

Like other upgrades, players increase the point cost of creatures that take these upgrades. 

**False Object:** A creature that can change shape into a tree, statue or other obstacle or item can take this upgrade. When placing terrain, place one additional obstacle or item of the same Size as the disguised creature. In secret, the player whose creature has False Object identifies which obstacle or item is actually the creature in disguise. 

At any time that a creature is within 2 squares of the disguised creature, the disguised creature can as a reaction leave its disguise and take a Strike or Stride action. Replace the obstacle or item with the creature’s miniature. 

The creature can also leave its disguise by choice, at the end of any round. However, in that case it cannot be activated in that round (only in subsequent rounds). 

**Summonable:** A creature that comes from another plane can take this upgrade. When deploying, leave this creature out of play. 

At any point during play, an allied creature who can cast spells can spend 2 AP and place the summonable creature in an adjacent unoccupied space. The summonable creature can act that round. 

**Tempting Disguise:** A creature that can change shape into something alluring can take this upgrade. When placing objectives, place one additional objective. In secret, the player whose creature has Tempting Disguise identifies which objective is actually the creature in disguise. 

When a creature attempts to interact with the disguised creature, their skill check automatically fails. Replace the objective with the creature’s miniature. That creature can be activated as normal at some point during the round (and ongoing after that).

The creature can also leave its disguise by choice, at the end of any round. However, in that case it cannot be activated in that round (only in subsequent rounds). 

**Trail of Bodies:** A creature that makes use of dead bodies, like a zombie hulk, can begin play with 1d6 dead bodies scattered around the map (players alternate placing them where they wish). 

## Spotting a disguised creature

A creature within 6 squares of a disguised creature (Tempting Disguise, Statue Disguise, etc) or an objective, statue, etc that might *be* a disguised creature, can Interact with it provided they have line of effect. Make a Perception check against the disguised creature’s Power. On a success, the player who controls the relevant creature reveal whether what is being Interacted with is in fact the disguised creature or not.

# Appendix: Campaign play

The following rules can be used to play with the same creatures over many scenarios. 

## Recovering

After a scenario, all creatures heal all damage and lose all conditions. All spell effects end. 

All features (including spells) that are usable once per encounter (🄴) are usable again. The scenario will specify if all features that are usable once per day (🄳) are usable again too. As a rule of thumb, creatures should recover their daily features after every third scenario. 

## Injuries

Roll 1d6 for each creature that was eliminated in the scenario. 

Table 1: Eliminated creatures

| **D6** | **Outcome**   | **Effect**                                         |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2    | Out of Action | The creature cannot be used in  the next scenario. |
| 3–4    | Wounded       | Roll on the injuries table.                        |
| 5–6    | Full recovery | The creature is good as new.                       |

 

Table 2: Injuries

| **D6** | **Injury**  | **Effect**                                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Injured Leg | -1 Speed.                                       |
| **2**  | Injured Eye | -1 Fight.                                       |
| **3**  | Befuddled   | -1 Power.                                       |
| **4**  | Cursed      | -1 Fortitude, Reflex and Will.                  |
| **5**  | Fragile     | -1 Armor                                        |
| **6**  | Weakened    | Start the encounter with the slowed  condition. |

 

A creature that already has a wound that would become Wounded again instead has that wound permanently. Otherwise, a wounded creature that completes a scenario with that wound loses the wound. 

## Advancement

Each time a creature participates in a scenario, they get an upgrade. Roll 3d6 for each creature to see what upgrade they receive. 

Table 3: Upgrades

| **Result** | **Benefit**  | **Result** | **Benefit** |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| **3**      | Feat         | **11**     | +1 Power    |
| **4**      | +1 Will      | **12**     | +1 Armor    |
| **5**      | +1 Fortitude | **13**     | +1 Will     |
| **6**      | +1 Armor     | **14**     | Feat        |
| **7**      | Feat         | **15**     | +1 Attack   |
| **8**      | +1 Fortitude | **16**     | +1 Power    |
| **9**      | +1 Reflex    | **17**     | +1 Will     |
| **10**     | +1 Attack    | **18**     | +1 Reflex   |

 

Immediately upon receiving every third upgrade, a creature goes up a level (and their points cost increases commensurately). Their hit points and damage also increase. 

*Hit Points:* Increases as specified by their class. For creatures without a class, find a class that would give them roughly equivalent hit points at their current level, and follow its progression. 

*Damage:* Look up their previous level and damage, and compare it with the damage in the same column for the new level. 

Table 4: Damage progression

| **Level** | **Extreme** | **High** | **Mod** | **Low** | **Area  Unlimited** | **Area  Limited** |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |

## Class table

Use this table to determine how a class is expected to progress in terms of damage and HP, and what the expected starting stats are for first level creatures of that class. 

When converting creatures over from PF2e, it is perfectly okay for their numbers to differ from those given here. They have been built using different, valid rules.

 Appendix: Gridless and 3D play

For the most part, you can play *Path 2 Victory* without a grid by substituting “inches” any time the game refers to “squares”. Measure diagonal movement normally instead of imposing an extra cost for it. 

## Ranges

Something is within range if the distance between any point on the edge of the base of the attacker and any point on the edge of the base of the target is less than or equal to the range. 

## Adjacency

A creature is adjacent to another if there is less than 1 inch between both creatures’ bases. 

## Targeting

Look from the attacking figure’s perspective. If any part of the target figure is visible, the attacking figure has line of sight. If any part of the target figure is obscured, it has cover or concealment (as applicable). 

If any model that is sculpted unusually (for example, they are kneeling, or have been posed standing on a large rock), imagine it standing in a neutral pose to determine line of sight, cover and concealment. 

## Areas of effect

Measure emanations and bursts as circles of the radius specified (bursts are measured from a point, emanations from the edge of the base of the creature causing the emanation). 

Measure cones as quarter-circles of the radius specified. 

Measure lines as 1-inch wide lines of the length specified. 

## 3D play

*Path 2 Victory* can be played with fully-modelled terrain, and creatures moving in the vertical axis (“3D play). However, you will have to give thought to how ranged combat and flight can be balanced, if some creatures can move (and stay) out of melee range. 

# Appendix: Adventure play and the cardboard AI

In this variant, dice rolls determine how enemy creatures act, allowing a player to run an adventure or campaign by themselves.

The player’s creatures are referred to as “adventurers” and the AI’s creatures as “monsters”.

## Early and late turns

At the start of each round, the player decides whether each adventurer will act early or late. 

Each adventurer that acts early gets 2 AP on its turn. If late, it gets 3 AP on its turn. 

Monsters can act “super-early”, typically only getting 1 AP or taking a special defensive action. 

Early adventurers act before early monsters, but after super-early monsters. Late adventurers act before late monsters. 

Within each phase, the player decides which creature acts first (for example, the player chooses which of their early adventurers takes their turn first; they also choose which early monster takes its turn first.)

**Order:** Super-early monsters (Ⅰ), early adventurers, early monsters (Ⅱ), late adventurers, late monsters (Ⅲ).

## Gambits

Monsters have fixed actions on their turn, called “gambits”. To determine which gambit a monster uses, roll 1d6 for each type of monster (“Goblin Warrior”, “Flash Beetle”, etc.) at the start of each round (after the player has chosen whether each adventurer is acting early or late). 

The gambit will say which dice results lead to the monster pursuing that gambit, whether the monster is acting super-early (Ⅰ), early (Ⅱ) or late (Ⅲ), and which actions it is pursuing. 

Cardboard AI creatures do not have limited uses of their actions. The gambit system in effect reflects limited uses by having some actions be rarer than others. Similarly, cardboard AI creatures ignore the action point rules: they take whichever actions their roll dictates.

### Interpreting the entries

A slash between actions means the monster chooses one of those actions: preferring attacks over movement, and preferring melee attacks if it can make them over ranged attacks. 

An arrow means after taking the original action, the monster takes the subsequent action. 

### Targeting

Find out the monster’s “preferred” target, following this order until there is no ambiguity about who the monster targets:

\1.    Enemies within range of their attack, or able to be within range with the movement the monster has available.

\2.    (When using an area attack) Maximising the number of enemies targeted. 

\3.    Enemies listed as their “preferred” enemy.

\4.    Enemies that are nearest.

\5.    Enemies that are yet to act.

\6.    Enemies with the lowest current HP.

\7.    Enemies with the lowest Armor.

Monsters who have no enemies in range move towards whichever enemy they can get in range of with their movement, again preferring enemies based on the order given above. 

Monsters do not target helpless creatures. 

### Interpreting movement actions

**Shift:** The monster takes the Step action. If the monster has a melee action coming up, it Steps to get an enemy within reach. Otherwise, it Steps away from enemies. 

**Charge:** If the monster is already within melee reach of an enemy, it does not move. Otherwise, the monster takes the Stride action towards its preferred target. 

**Reposition:** The monster takes the Stride action towards its preferred target, even if it is already in melee reach of an enemy.

**Retreat:** The monster takes the Stride action moving as far away from all enemies as possible. 

**Stride:** The monster moves so its subsequent actions are most effective (into range, into reach, out of melee reach of enemies if it is making ranged attacks) against its preferred target. If it has no applicable subsequent actions, it moves into melee reach of its preferred target. 

### Example

Here are the gambits for the taxidermic dog. On a roll of 1, it takes no actions but becomes resistant to all damage. On a roll of 4, it acts in the early monster phase, by moving (preferring an enemy already adjacent to an ally even if it is already adjacent to another enemy) and then biting with its jaws.
